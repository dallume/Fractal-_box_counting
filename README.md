# Fractal-_box_counting
It's about my thesis project. Part of the work was writing a simple code in Matlab to generate binary image of perimeters of glaciers (any bidimensional figure). You will also find code to generate pre-fractals through the technique of iterating function system and to calculate the box-counting fractal dimension of bidimesional  figure.
